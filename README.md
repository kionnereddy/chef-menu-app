This README consists of all the changes I have made to my code from the part 2 submission:
1) I added a remove item button for all the meals displayed so you can delete them.
2) I added a new "Filter Menu by course" page that filters the different courses, eg. if you want to see the starters only you can see a list of all the starters. Same for the mains and desserts.
3) I styled the Filter Menu by course button to make it stand out more and look more visually appleasing.
4) I styled the button on the bottom of the filter screen to stand out more and be more noticeable.
